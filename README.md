# Project_Toys_and_models

This is a project conducted during my Data Analyst courses at Wild Code School.

The mission is to create a dashboard with KPI's about four topics:
 - Sales: The number of products sold by category and by month, with comparison and rate of change compared to the same month of the previous year.
 - Finances: 
    - The turnover of the orders of the last two months by country.
    - Orders that have not yet been paid.
 - Logistics: The stock of the 5 most ordered products.
 - Human Resources: Each month, the 2 sellers with the highest turnover.

Any relevant KPI could be added to the mandatory ones above.

The goal of this project is to practice SQL and a Dataviz tool (Power BI, Tableau).

Every KPI mentioned above must be reached using a specific SQL request and not using filters in the Dataviz tool.
